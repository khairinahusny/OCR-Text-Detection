#### About:
Text detection in natural images has vital role in the field of artificial intelligence and other innovations. It helps to remove noise in images and identify
text. Nonetheless, it is additionally a difficult issue because of the variability in imaging conditions, for example, lighting, specular reflections, commotion, obscure, and
nearness of blocks over the content, and in the changeability of the content itself. 

In identifying text from natural images, basic digital image processing techniques are used to detect text from the images. This includes preprocessing, extraction or text localization, classification and character detection.

#### Objectives:
- [ ] Detecting character-level on sample natural images
- [ ] Using webcam to detect text in real-time

#### Detecting text from a small video file

Using sample video, we are trying to apply OCR (pytesseract) in extracting text from a video file.
